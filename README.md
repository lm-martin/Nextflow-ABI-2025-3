# Nexflow-ABI-2025-3

This repository contains scripts and nextflow pipelines developed in the fifth module of my further education program 
Applied Bioinformatics and Biostatistics ABI-2025-3, provided by CQ Beratung + Bildung GmbH.

The codes deposited here were intended for orientation, learning, and training purposes only. 
Some of them could be very primitive, some others are more elaborated.
In any case, they might contain issues. They might be subseptible of large improvements.

It was fun learning nextflow.
I am open to suggestions and recomendations on how to improve them, 
so I can learn more.
